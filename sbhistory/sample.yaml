# Copy this file to 'sbhistory.yaml' and complete with your site details. If you have
# a multisma2 configuration you can replace the one here.  The sbhistory software uses
# the site, solar properties, database, and inverter settings from multisma2 and adds
# a few of its own for the start and outputs.

sbhistory:
  # Starting date to pull history from inverters
  # Set the date to start the collection, make sure your database retention policy covers
  # this start date, collection is up the current day.
  start:
    year: 2021
    month: 1
    day: 1

  # Select the outputs you want to populate the database
  #   - fine_history is Wh meter in 5 minute increments (limited history)
  #   - daily_history is Wh meter in daily increments
  #   - irradiance_history is an estimate of local irradiation (W)
  outputs:
    fine_history: True
    daily_history: True
    irradiance_history: True

  # Solar array properties for predicting potential solar radiation, azimuth and tilt are degrees,

  # replace this with a function to vary by month).

  # InfluxDB setup
  # The InfluxDB interface uses the newer 2.0 client which supports both the 2.0 and 1.8.x InfluxDB versions
  # with just minor changes in the configuration making a future upgrade to v2 a simple change of options.
  #
  # Influxdb configuration options:
  #   influxdb2.enable        set to True to enable InfluxDB output, False to disable output
  #   influxdb2.bucket        set to the InfluxDB bucket (v2) or 'database/retention_policy' (v1.8)
  #   influxdb2.url           set to the InfluxDB server URL and port
  #   influxdb2.org           set to the v2 organization or '-' if using v1.8.x
  #   influxdb2.token         set to a valid v2 token or v1.8.x 'username:password'
